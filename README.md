# Implementation-and-Reproduction-of-Contrastive-Attention-Model-CAt-

Aspect detection is a widely researched field of natural language processing in
which the goal is to identify and extract terms relevant to opinion mining and
sentiment analysis. We present the implementation and reproduction of a system,
Contrastive Attention (CAt ), a novel single-head attention mechanism based
on an RBF kernel which makes our system interpretable besides the significant
performance boost. While, to the best of our knowledge, previous literature relied
on syntactic features and complex neural models, we experimentally prove that
complex models and architectures are not necessary for this task.
